# Agentforce CLT — Reference Pattern Catalog

These eight patterns are field-tested CLT shapes that have shipped in Agentforce demos. Use them as recipes: pick the closest shape, copy the data contract, adapt the LWC. Each one is a working unmanaged package — install to inspect, then bring into Cursor/Claude to customize.

When the user describes a problem, map it to a pattern first; building from scratch is rarely needed.

## 0. The JSON-string envelope (read first — the canonical wiring)

Every pattern below sits on top of one binding shape. Use it unless you have a verified reason not to:

- **Renderer DTO** — a tiny `global` class with **one** `@AuraEnabled String <name>JSON` field (`@JsonAccess`, two constructors). One per renderer; never shared.
- **Service** — `@InvocableMethod` returning `List<Response>`; `Response` carries the DTO under one key (`@InvocableVariable`, typed as the DTO class, displayable and **filtered from the planner**) **plus** a short narrative and/or 2–3 passthrough scalars the planner *can* read. Path A: `copilotAction:isDisplayable: true` / `isUsedByPlanner: false` on the card. Path B: `is_displayable: True` / `filter_from_agent: True` on the card. These two flags are independent — `is_displayable` gates the render tool; filtering hides the JSON so the planner does not narrate it.
- **LightningType** — `schema.json` → `@apexClassType/c__<DtoClass>`; `lightningDesktopGenAi/renderer.json` → `c/<lwc>` (no `enhancedWebChat/`, no `attributes`).
- **LWC** — simple `@api value`; `JSON.parse(this.value.<name>JSON)` in `connectedCallback()` with try/catch + `#### ...` breadcrumb + sentinel `{"error":...}` handling; targets `lightning__AgentforceOutput` (+`Input`), no `sourceType`/`targetConfigs`.
- **Instructions** — explicit ShowCommand language naming the displayable output (see SKILL.md).

A list is just an array inside the JSON string — there is no separate "collection" binding mode.

### Working references

**Path A / SRA:** eight `summitRidge*Output` Lightning Types. Generate new cards with `sf-clt-builder`. Card JSON filtered from the planner; chaining scalars unfiltered. Channel folder `lightningDesktopGenAi` only.

**Path B / Employee Agent — LEA "Sales Copilot":** two renderers built on the envelope, good to mirror:

- **`LEA_AccountHealth` — single status card.** DTO `LEA_AccountHealthData` (`healthJSON`); LWC `leaAccountHealth` parses `{ accountId, accountName, status: GREEN|YELLOW|RED, reason, activity, engagement, risks[] }` and color-codes the card (uses `NavigationMixin` to open the account). Service `LEA_AccountService` returns `accountHealth` (displayable) + `result` (narrative).
- **`LEA_DailyPriorities` — list card.** DTO `LEA_DailyPrioritiesData` (`prioritiesJSON`) holding an array; LWC `leaDailyPriorities` renders the prioritized list. Service `LEA_DailyWorkloadService` returns `dailyPriorities` (displayable) + `result` (narrative). Same envelope as the single card — the list lives in the JSON.

Both `.agent` subagents (`AccountIntelligence`, `DailyWorkload`) use the CRITICAL "you MUST present the `<output>` output … do NOT summarize as plain text" instruction block.

## 1. Dynamic Product Carousel

**Use when** the agent needs to surface 1–N items the user browses sideways: products, recommendations, time slots, agents. Each card has title, description, image, a "stage" pill, and an AM/PM/AM-PM time indicator (sun/moon icon).

**Shape (Apex)**
- `List<CarouselCard>` where `CarouselCard` has: `title` (String), `description` (String), `imageUrl` (String), `stage` (String — shown as side label), `time` (String — `"AM"`, `"PM"`, or `"AM/PM"`).

**LWC notes**
- Horizontal scroll container, snap on cards.
- The "stage" is the white side text (e.g., "PREP").
- Sun/moon icon driven entirely by the `time` value.

**Install (reference)**: `04tHo0000012vh3` — package `ASA_ProductCarouselCardsStage`, Lightning Type `asaCarousel`.

---

## 2. Dynamic Item Selector

**Use when** the agent asks the user to choose one or many from a generated list: appointment options, product variants, cases to merge.

**Shape (Apex)**
- `title` (String), `mode` (String: `"single"` or `"multiple"`), `options` (`List<Option>`), where `Option` has `id`, `label`, optional `description`, optional `imageUrl`.
- Output back to the agent: selected option(s) returned as the utterance.

**LWC notes**
- Single-select uses radio cards; multi-select uses checkbox cards with a Submit button.
- Build a `test-single` and `test-multiple` mode early — saves a lot of round-trip iteration.

**Install (reference)**: `04tHo0000012wAl` — package `ASA_ItemSelector`, Lightning Type `asaItemSelector`.

---

## 3. Add to Cart / Quote

**Use when** the chat needs a transactional CTA: "add this to cart", "add to quote", "order this".

**Shape (Apex)**
- Either single item or `List<Item>`. Each item: `title`, `description`, `imageUrl`, `defaultQuantity` (Integer), `callToAction` (String — button label, e.g., `"Add to Cart"`).
- Agent sets all four dynamically per render.

**LWC notes**
- Quantity stepper + CTA button.
- On click, dispatch `valuechange` so the action records what was added.

**Install (reference)**: `04tHo0000012wNY` — package `ASA_AddToCartQuote`, Lightning Type `asaAddItem`.

---

## 4. Embedded Form (with conditional visibility)

**Use when** you need 3–8 structured fields collected mid-chat, with branching: "if Country = Canada, show province dropdown".

**Shape (Apex)**
- `title` (String), `submitText` (String), `fields` (`List<FormField>`).
- `FormField`: `id`, `label`, `type` (`"text"|"email"|"phone"|"select"`), `required` (Boolean), `options` (`List<String>` for select), `width` (`"half"` or `"full"`), `showIf` (`{ field, value }`).

**Example payload**
```json
{
  "title": "Contact Information",
  "submitText": "Submit",
  "fields": [
    { "id": "country", "label": "Where is your business based?",
      "type": "select", "options": ["Canada", "USA"], "required": true },
    { "id": "firstName", "label": "First Name", "type": "text",
      "required": true, "width": "half",
      "showIf": { "field": "country", "value": "Canada" } }
  ]
}
```

**LWC notes**
- Renders as a vertical stack; pairs of `width: "half"` fields render side-by-side.
- On submit, the entire form is sent back as the user's utterance (so the agent has all values in context).

**Install (reference)**: `04tWt000000DyRN` — package `ASA_AsaLeadForm`, Lightning Type `asaLeadForm`.

---

## 5. File Upload v1 — Confirm & Send

**Use when** the user must attach files that get logged on the chat session record itself (Messaging Session). Simpler permission model.

**Shape (Apex)**
- `title`, `acceptedFormats` (`List<String>`), `maxFiles` (Integer), `maxSizeMb` (Integer).

**Wire-up gotchas**
- ESD site **must** have CORS configured to my-domain or upload silently fails.
- Agent user needs full access to Messaging Session object.
- Files become ContentDocuments linked to the Messaging Session.

**Install (reference)**: `04tWt000000Dyb3` — package `ASA_FileUpload`, Lightning Type `asaFileUpload`.

---

## 6. File Upload v2 — Send & Summarize (target record)

**Use when** files attach to a specific record (Case, Account, custom object) the agent identifies via instructions.

**Shape (Apex)**
- `targetRecordId` (Id, set by the agent), `acceptedFormats`, `maxFiles`, `maxSizeMb`.
- Apex action takes `targetRecordId` as input and returns a `FileUploadResponse` shape.

**Wire-up gotchas**
- Same CORS requirement as v1.
- Agent action is built directly from an Apex action class (`FileUploadAction`), not a Flow — simpler than v1.
- Agent instructions must explicitly tell the model which record ID to use.

**Install (reference)**: `04tKZ000000xyKu` — Lightning Type `fileUploadResponse`, Apex `FileUploadAction`.

---

## 7. Send Formatted URL

**Use when** the agent surfaces a single link as a styled card instead of a raw URL — for product pages, articles, deep links.

**Shape (Apex)**
- `title` (String), `url` (String), optional `description`, optional `imageUrl`.
- Note: `_self` target does **not** work — link opens in a new tab.

**Install (reference)**: `04tWt000000Dyj7` — package `ASA_SendURL`, Lightning Type `asaOpenLink`.

---

## 8. Article Cards (long-form + recommended links)

**Use when** the agent answers from a knowledge article and wants to embed the article content plus a list of related links — common in healthcare, financial services, legal.

**Shape (Apex)**
- `articleTitle` (String), `articleBody` (String, rich text or HTML), `recommendedContent` (`List<Link>`), where `Link = { text, url }`.

**LWC notes**
- The component is intentionally **extra-wide** to minimize scrolling. Enhanced Chat v2 doesn't allow setting `width` in setup yet, so the embedding page must use the inline embed methods (not the floating launcher) to give it the room.

**Install (reference)**: `04tHu000004VUbc` — package `ArticleViewerCLT`, Lightning Type `asaArticleWithLinks`.

---

## Bonus — Employee Agent Embedded Screen Flow

The Employee Agent (LEX assist panel) has a constraint: it can't push utterances back to the agent. So the canonical pattern is to embed a Screen Flow that the agent has pre-populated with input variables. The user completes the form, then copy/pastes the result back into chat.

**Shape (Apex)**
```json
{
  "flowApiName": "Submit_Deal_Support_Request",
  "inputVariables": [
    { "name": "recordId", "value": "001XXX...", "type": "String" }
  ]
}
```

**Channel folder**: `lightningDesktopGenAi/` only.

**Install (reference)**: `04tWt000000E2un` — package `AEA_EmbeddedScreenFlow`, Lightning Type `aeaEmbeddedScreenFlow`.

---

## When you can't find a matching pattern

Default to **Pattern 1 (Carousel)** if it's a list of similar things, **Pattern 4 (Form)** if it's collecting structured input, or **Pattern 7 (Formatted URL)** if it's pointing the user somewhere.
