# Help Agent — Setup Spec

> **Who this is for.** You're a Salesforce admin standing up the Help Agent. You will *run* the setup flow (a guided, checkpoint-by-checkpoint conversation) and you need to *understand* the agent that gets built — its topics, subagents, and what it's allowed to do — so you can review it in Agentforce Builder and explain it to stakeholders. You are **not** hand-authoring the `.agent` YAML: the skills generate that from the canonical script in [`references/agent-script.md`](../references/agent-script.md). Read that script for comprehension when you reach agent creation (after Checkpoint 2), not to edit it block-by-block.

> **How to read this file.** §1–§2 tell you what you're building and its shape at a glance. §3 is the global voice/behavior. §4 is the execution flow you'll walk the user through — readiness, then four checkpoints. Reference details (placeholders, package deps, deployment target) live in §5–§6 right where the flow needs them or as a short appendix. §7 points to the full canonical agent script (`references/agent-script.md`), which you load only at agent-creation time. **Progressive disclosure:** the large or conditional pieces — the agent script and each channel branch — live in `references/` and are read only when the flow reaches them, so this file stays small in context.

---

## 1. What this is and why it exists

Create a Salesforce Agentforce Service Agent ("help agent") in the connected org with the shape and behavior described in the agent script (§7), then expose it on a customer-facing Experience Cloud site via an embedded chat widget.

This file is the spec for the Help Agent we're building. The accompanying Claude Code prompt will simply reference this file ("create an agent out of the spec I have created here in `assets/help-agent-spec.md`"). Use the skills under `.claude/skills/` — do **not** author a new Help Agent skill. The relevant skills in this repo are `agentforce-generate` (agent authoring + Agentforce Data Library provisioning/grounding, in its `references/data-library-reference.md` and `references/org-setup-for-adl.md`), `dx-org-permission-set-assign`, `service-digital-engagement-channel-configure` (messaging channel creation), `service-agentforce-channel-configure` (wires the created channel to the agent — fallback queue + `sessionHandlerAsa`), `service-digital-engagement-deployment-configure`, `experience-lwr-site-generate`, and `service-digital-engagement-messaging-site-integrate` (widget placement + embed, used in Checkpoint 3.5 and Checkpoint 4). The spec is custom data feeding standard skills, not a new skill itself.

**Why the spec, not an API.** Salesforce's official Help Agent template-creation API is not yet shipped. Without that API, you (Claude) have no built-in concept of "Help Agent" and would otherwise generate a generic agent. This file substitutes for the missing API: the agent script in §7 is the canonical template that the eventual Quick Start UI will produce. Treat it as the source-of-truth shape — the agent you build should have the same lineage (topics, actions, instructions) as the agent that template would create.

**In scope:**

- Knowledge-grounded Q&A using Salesforce Knowledge, uploaded files (file-based Agentforce Data Library), or website-sourced content.
- Case management — create new cases on behalf of the customer and report on existing cases.

## 2. Agent shape at a glance

The agent is one front-door **router** that hands off to **four subagents**. In plain language:

- **Agent Router** *(front door)* — greets the customer, reads their intent, and routes to the right subagent. It's the only entry point; there is no separate topic selector.
- **Service Customer Verification** — confirms who the customer is (via an emailed verification code) before anything sensitive happens. Anything touching orders, cases, account details, or personal data goes through here first. Once verified in a session, the customer isn't re-verified.
- **General FAQ** — answers company/product/policy questions by searching Knowledge articles (grounded on the Agentforce Data Library). If the customer actually wants a case created, or if the knowledge search itself fails, it routes to verification → case management instead of dead-ending.
- **Case Management** — creates new support cases, looks up existing cases, and adds comments — all for a *verified* customer.
- **Escalation** — hands off to a live human agent when asked; if no human is available, it falls back to creating a support case.

Routing rules the sysadmin should know:

- Verification gates the sensitive paths. `isVerified` is the switch: while `False`, the router sends sensitive/case work to **Verification**; once `True`, straight to **Case Management**.
- **FAQ** and **Escalation** are reachable without verification (answering a policy question or asking for a human doesn't require identity).
- Both **FAQ** and **Escalation** have the same safety net: a failed action (empty knowledge search, no human available) becomes an *offer to create a case*, not a dead end.

Each of these maps to a block in §7 — the router is `start_agent agent_router`, and the four subagents are `subagent ServiceCustomerVerification / GeneralFAQ / CaseManagement / Escalation`. The agent script defines all of them; build the agent as-written and don't surgically drop topics — the script is the source of truth for shape.

---

## 3. Global behavioral rules (apply throughout the flow)

**Persona for all user-facing prompts.** When you ask the user anything during this setup, speak as a **calm, patient, friendly service agent** — first-person, warm, never robotic. Short sentences. One question (or one tight group of related questions) per checkpoint. Acknowledge each answer before moving on ("Great, got it." / "Perfect — moving on."). Never dump a wall of options without context. This is a guided conversation, not a form.

**No unexplained acronyms in user-facing text.** Customers are not expected to know Salesforce internal jargon. Terms like **ADL** (Agentforce Data Library), **ESD** (Embedded Service Deployment), **PS/PSL** (Permission Set / Permission Set License), **MIAW** (Messaging for In-App and Web), **ASA** (Agentforce Service Agent), **JWT** (JSON Web Token), **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and similar shorthand may appear internally in this spec and in skill logic, but **must be either expanded on first use or replaced with a plain-language description** when shown to the user. Prefer plain-language descriptions (e.g. "Knowledge library that grounds the agent's answers") over acronym-with-expansion when possible. If you find yourself typing an acronym into a user-facing message, stop and rewrite.

**Interactive, never one-shot.** This setup mirrors the Help Agent Quick Setup wizard. Walk the user through **four checkpoints**, in order. At each checkpoint, ask the questions, **wait for the user's reply**, confirm what you heard, then proceed. Do not move to the next checkpoint without explicit user input.

---

## 4. Execution flow

The checkpoints below are both the conversation you run *and* the order the underlying work executes in. Each checkpoint states what it provisions and links to the script block (§7) it fills.

### 4.0 Readiness check (silent, before Checkpoint 1)

Before Checkpoint 1, silently run a **readiness check**. **THIS PHASE IS MANDATORY. Run the steps in exactly the order below — reordering fails with a concrete, unambiguous error, and previous runs have wasted cycles on it. Specifically, running step 3 (permission-set assignment) before step 2 (Data Cloud enablement) fails with:**

> `PermissionSet not found: GenieUserEnhancedSecurity`

The Data Cloud permission sets *do not exist in the org* until Data Cloud is turned on in step 2. If you see that exact error, you (or a prior run) skipped ahead — go back to step 2 and confirm Data Cloud is enabled before retrying step 3.

**Step 1 — Detect.** Use `agentforce-generate` (feature/Data-Cloud detection lives in its `references/org-setup-for-adl.md` Step 0) to verify: Agentforce, Einstein Generative AI, Knowledge, Experience Cloud, **and Data Cloud** are enabled. Verify the running user has the licenses/permissions/SKUs needed for Agentforce + Embedded Messaging + Experience Cloud.

**Step 2 — Enable anything missing.** If any of the features above are off (especially **Data Cloud** — it's the most commonly disabled and it's the one that gates step 3), enable them via `agentforce-generate` before doing anything else. If something is missing and cannot be enabled, surface the gap to the user clearly and stop. **Do not proceed to step 3 until every required feature is confirmed enabled** — re-run detection if needed to confirm.

  > **If Data Cloud is not yet provisioned, offer the user a choice up front.** Data Cloud provisioning can be enabled programmatically (`CustomerDataPlatformSettings.enableCustomerDataPlatform: true` — see `agentforce-generate/references/org-setup-for-adl.md`) but the underlying platform work takes time to finish in the background. Give the user two options before proceeding: (a) enable Data Cloud now and pause the flow — they can come back and resume once provisioning completes; (b) wait through it in this session, which may take some minutes. Do not silently block on provisioning without asking.

**Step 3 — CRITICAL/MANDATORY: Assign the Data Cloud permission sets immediately after step 2 completes.** This step is non-negotiable and must run the moment enablement finishes — do not defer it, do not batch it with Checkpoint 1, do not skip it because "the org looks fine." Skipping it ships a broken agent: grounding returns empty `knowledgeSummary` results at runtime even though ADL indexing reports SUCCESS. This is a hard prerequisite for Knowledge grounding, not optional polish.

  Both the **running user** (so they can configure the Agentforce Data Library) and the **Einstein Agent User** (so the agent's retriever returns results at runtime) need Data Cloud access. Defer to `agentforce-generate` for this: it resolves the Einstein Agent User, assigns the required Data Cloud permission set and license, and verifies the assignment stuck. Do not resolve the user or assign permission sets by hand here.

  Note: the Data Space scope on that permission set is a separate UI-only step that cannot be automated — that's handled reactively in Checkpoint 3.5 (Check 2) if grounded queries still return empty after ADL indexing completes.

**Managed-package prerequisite (deterministic check — do not improvise).** The script's actions reference sources that must resolve in the org before agent creation:

- `SvcCopilotTmpl__*` — Service Cloud Copilot Template (verification, case-management actions, flows).
- `EmployeeCopilot__AnswerQuestionsWithKnowledge` — Employee Copilot (knowledge search action).

> **These are Salesforce out-of-the-box platform artifacts, not AppExchange managed packages.** They're surfaced when `Settings:EinsteinGpt.enableEinsteinGptPlatform` is `true` on the org, and they will **not** show up in `sf package installed list`. Do not diagnose their absence by looking at installed packages — check `enableEinsteinGptPlatform` via `sf project retrieve start --metadata "Settings:EinsteinGpt"` instead. If Einstein GPT Platform is off, turn it on.

Follow this exact branch — every run resolves the same way regardless of org or model:

1. **Verify the setting is on.** Retrieve `Settings:EinsteinGpt` and check `enableEinsteinGptPlatform`. If `false`, deploy `enableEinsteinGptPlatform: true` and re-verify. **The setting being `true` is the authoritative Einstein-GPT-Platform readiness signal.** Do not use `sf package installed list` or `InstalledSubscriberPackage` — these are not installed subscriber packages, and those queries return zero rows even on healthy orgs.

2. **Then probe how the artifacts surfaced on this org.** With `enableEinsteinGptPlatform=true`, the actions the script depends on can appear on the org in one of two shapes. Enumerate both to figure out which shape applies:
   ```bash
   SELECT DeveloperName FROM Flow WHERE NamespacePrefix = 'SvcCopilotTmpl' LIMIT 1
   sf org list metadata --metadata-type GenAiFunction | head
   sf org list metadata --metadata-type Bot | head
   ```

3. **Take exactly one of three outcomes based on what's in the org:**

   - **(A) Standard namespaces present** (the `SvcCopilotTmpl` / `EmployeeCopilot` probes return rows) → proceed to agent creation using the canonical action references from §7 (`SvcCopilotTmpl__Send_Verification_Code_to_Customer`, `EmployeeCopilot__AnswerQuestionsWithKnowledge`, etc.). This is the standard path on a bare Developer Edition where `enableEinsteinGptPlatform=true` surfaces the namespaces cleanly.

   - **(B) Namespaces absent but unnamespaced equivalents present** → this is the **trial or preloaded sample-data org** shape: the org came preloaded with the underlying artifacts directly (as `Send_Verification_Code_to_Customer`, `AnswerQuestionsWithKnowledge`, `Create_New_Case`, `Get_Customer_Order`, etc.) rather than under the `SvcCopilotTmpl` / `EmployeeCopilot` namespaces. **Adapt the script's action references to the unnamespaced names** — map `SvcCopilotTmpl__X` → `X` and `EmployeeCopilot__X` → `X` for the subset of actions referenced by §7. Surface this substitution to the user explicitly before applying it (they should know the deployed agent references the org's local, unnamespaced actions rather than the standard-template ones).

   - **(C) Neither namespaced nor unnamespaced equivalents present** → **hard stop.** The agent's actions cannot resolve on this org shape. Tell the user exactly which specific action names are missing and stop. Options for the user: (a) move to a bare Developer Edition where `enableEinsteinGptPlatform=true` produces the standard namespaces, or (b) get the required Bot / GenAiFunction metadata installed on this org by hand. Do not proceed to agent creation.

4. **Never create the agent without running the probe in step 2 first.** Silently assuming the namespaces are present based on the setting alone (or silently rewriting references without user awareness) is not allowed — step 2 is what tells you which of the three branches applies.

### 4.1 Checkpoint 1 — Meet Your Agent

*Provisions:* the placeholder values wired into the script's `config`, `system`, and `language` blocks (§7). *Fills:* `<agent_label_placeholder>`, `<developer_name_placeholder>`, `<agent_welcome_message_placeholder>`, `<agent_tone_placeholder>`, `<gc:languageSettings_language>`.

Ask the user for four things (you can ask together):
1. **Agent Name** — used for both the user-facing label (`<agent_label_placeholder>`) and the API/developer name (`<developer_name_placeholder>`; sanitize to alphanumeric + underscore, no leading digit). Offer the user two options: accept the default **`Help Agent`**, or type a name of their own choosing. Do not present a list of alternative names — just the default vs. custom.
2. **Language** — used for `language: default_locale` (`<gc:languageSettings_language>`). Default suggestion: `en_US` (English).
3. **Welcome Greeting** — used for `<agent_welcome_message_placeholder>`. Suggest a neutral default the user can accept or override (e.g. *"Hi, I'm {Agent Name}. How can I help you today?"*).
4. **Tone** — used for `<agent_tone_placeholder>`. Ask the user how they want the agent to sound when speaking with customers. They can describe it in their own words (e.g. *"friendly and casual, like a knowledgeable friend"*, *"formal and precise, like a banking concierge"*, *"playful, upbeat, brand-forward"*) or accept the default: *"calm, patient, friendly service agent — warm but professional, short sentences, never robotic."* Keep the captured tone string to one or two sentences — long persona prose competes with action-routing instructions and degrades tool-calling reliability. Tone affects *how* the agent speaks, not *what* it's allowed to do; the verification, PII, and case-management rules in the subagent reasoning blocks are not overridable by tone.

### 4.2 Checkpoint 2 — Give Your Agent Context (grounding)

*Provisions:* an Agentforce Data Library, then wires its `rag_feature_config_id` into the script's `knowledge:` block (§7). *Fills:* `<rag_feature_config_id>`.

Present three grounding options and ask the user which one(s) they want:
- **Salesforce Knowledge** — ground on existing Knowledge articles, filtered by Data Category.
- **Upload Files** — ground on files the user provides.
- **Website Sync** *[Coming soon]* — fetch content from a public website.

Then, depending on selection:
- **If Salesforce Knowledge:** query the org for available Data Category Groups (and their categories) and **list them to the user**. Ask which specific categories the agent should ground on. Do not assume "all." Wire the selection into the ADL configuration.
- **If Upload Files:** ask the user to paste the file name (or file path) they want to upload. **After each file is submitted, present a selection prompt (e.g. via `AskUserQuestion`) with these options:**
  - **Upload another file** — collect the next file path and repeat.
  - **Done — proceed with these N files** — move on to ADL provisioning.

  Do not ask a yes/no question ("do you want to upload another?") — the user shouldn't have to type "yes" just to add another file. The selection itself is the action. Loop until the user picks "Done", then provision a file-based Agentforce Data Library with the full collected list.
- **If Website Sync:** ask the user for the website URL to fetch content from. Configure the data library to sync that URL.

The `rag_feature_config_id` returned by ADL provisioning gets wired into the agent script's `knowledge:` block — do not hardcode.

> **CRITICAL — Always create a fresh, named ADL for this agent — do not reuse `All_Records_and_Fields_Default`.** Every org ships with a stock library named `All Records and Fields (Default)` (DeveloperName `All_Records_and_Fields_Default`). It shows up in `sf agent adl list` with a valid `libraryId` and a `rag_feature_config_id` can be derived from it — but on trial or preloaded sample-data orgs it is typically stuck in `NOT_SCHEDULED` state and never actually indexes any content. Wiring the agent to that library produces empty `knowledgeSummary` at runtime even though the ID is valid and the platform reports no error.
>
> The right behavior: create a dedicated `Help_Agent_Knowledge` library at Checkpoint 2 (idempotent on DeveloperName — reuse only if it already exists AND its `indexingStatus.status ∈ {COMPLETED, READY, SUCCESS}`). Poll with `sf agent adl status --library-id <id>` and only wire the ID into the agent script's `knowledge:` block once the status is one of those terminal-success values. `NOT_SCHEDULED` is NOT a success signal — treat it as "must recreate."

> **`rag_feature_config_id` format.** The ID looks like `ARFPC_<libraryId>`, where `<libraryId>` is the 18-character ID returned by `adl create`. Note: `adl get` does NOT return a field named `ragFeatureConfigId` — the value only surfaces in the `adl publish` error message on a failed publish, and the format is documented in `references/agent-script.md`. If you can't find the value, run the publish once against a placeholder and read the ID out of the error, or construct it as `ARFPC_` + the library ID from `adl create`.

> **Knowledge ADL primary-index and content fields (read before configuring a Knowledge ADL).** Two related constraints — both silently break grounding if you get them wrong:
>
> 1. **`--primary-index-field1` and `--primary-index-field2` on `adl create` accept only *standard* KnowledgeArticleVersion fields** (`Title`, `Summary`, `Body`, `UrlName`, etc.). Custom `__c` fields on `Knowledge__kav` are rejected by the ADL API even though `Apex describeFields` confirms they exist. Use `Title` and `Summary` as the primary index fields.
> 2. **`--content-fields` on `adl update` also rejects custom `__c` fields** on `Knowledge__kav` in some org shapes — inspect the API response after `adl update` and fall back to standard rich-text fields (e.g. `Body`) if a custom field is rejected. **Do not list `Title` or `Summary` as content fields** either — the API rejects overlap with the primary index (`OVERLAPPING_CONTENT_FIELD`).
>
> **Pick body fields by inspection, not by name.** Query the org's `Knowledge__kav` schema and identify the rich-text body fields that actually contain article content (rich-text or long-text-area fields; describe the object and look for fields with type `TextArea` / `LongTextArea` and Length > 4000). Ask the user which one(s) hold the article body. Common patterns on Salesforce-shipped Knowledge configurations include `FAQ_Answer__c`, `KCSArticle_Issue__c`, and `KCSArticle_Resolution__c` — but these are conventions, not guarantees, and are not present on every org. Never assume a field name; inspect first. If the body-field set is wrong, grounded queries return empty results even though indexing reports SUCCESS.

**After Checkpoint 2, create the agent.** With placeholders (CP1) and `rag_feature_config_id` (CP2) in hand, create the agent per §7, then publish and activate it by deferring to `agentforce-generate` — it owns the publish/activate lifecycle, including the retry-on-transient-failure path. Do not hand-roll publish/activate here.

### 4.3 Checkpoint 3 — Add to Channels

*Provisions (Web Chat path):* a messaging channel + omni-channel routing (created via `service-digital-engagement-channel-configure`, then wired to the agent via `service-agentforce-channel-configure` — fallback queue + `sessionHandlerAsa`), a new Embedded Service Deployment (`Help Chat`), and a prepared LWR Experience Cloud site. The agent script (§7) does not change here — this is channel/site metadata around the agent.

Ask the user which channel(s) they want to expose the agent on. Present all three options, even though some require additional inputs:

- **Web Chat** — embed a chat widget on a website.
- **Help Portal** *[Coming soon]* — create a customer-facing Experience Cloud site with the agent built in.
- **Voice** *[Coming soon]* — let the agent handle phone calls.

**IMPORTANT — Coming-soon channels are hard stops, not aspirational selections.** If the user selects **Help Portal** or **Voice**, DO NOT attempt to build anything for that channel. Do not create supporting objects, records, or metadata "toward" the feature — provisioning a phone number, standing up a portal site, or wiring routing for these channels is out of scope and requires a dedicated skill that does not exist yet. Trying to fulfill them by creating adjacent objects produces broken half-configurations that look done but never work. Respond to the user verbatim: *"This feature is coming soon, please select Web Chat."* Then re-present the channel selection and wait for a supported choice — do not proceed until the user picks Web Chat.

Branch based on the user's selection. **Read only the reference file for the channel the user chose** — do not load all three:

- **If Web Chat** → read [`references/channel-web-chat.md`](../references/channel-web-chat.md) and follow it (domain, the critical `authMode`/"who's chatting" decision, channel + ESD + site provisioning, citations wiring). This is the only fully-supported channel.
- **If Help Portal** *(Coming soon)* → read [`references/channel-help-portal.md`](../references/channel-help-portal.md). It is a hard stop: respond *"This feature is coming soon, please select Web Chat."* and re-present the selection.
- **If Voice** *(Coming soon)* → read [`references/channel-voice.md`](../references/channel-voice.md). Also coming-soon; steer to Web Chat, and gracefully skip if the user insists on an existing number the org can't wire.

The user may pick more than one channel; handle each branch independently, reading each channel's file as you reach it. If a branch fails, report it plainly and continue with the others — do not abort the whole setup.

### 4.4 Checkpoint 3.5 — Silent pre-flight (internal only, DO NOT show the user)

**This is a silent internal gate between channel deployment and Checkpoint 4. Do NOT announce it, do NOT print a "running checks" message, do NOT tell the user it exists.** Its purpose is to catch the three failure modes that most commonly ship a broken agent to the user in Checkpoint 4. Run all checks silently; only surface output if a check FAILS, and only then to explain the specific fix needed before proceeding.

Run these three checks, in order. Every check must pass before advancing to Checkpoint 4.

**Check 1 — Data Cloud access is in place for both the running user and the Einstein Agent User.** Re-confirm the Data Cloud grounding prerequisites by deferring to `agentforce-generate` (the same gate used in the readiness phase). If it reports the access is missing or was changed out-of-band, re-run that gate; if it still fails, surface the specific missing user/permset and stop — do not proceed to Checkpoint 4.

**Check 2 — Agentforce Data Library is Activated AND grounded.** Using the `rag_feature_config_id` captured during Checkpoint 2:
  - Confirm the library is indexed and ready by deferring to `agentforce-generate`, which owns the readiness gate. Do not poll it here.
  - Execute a canary grounded retrieval query against the library (e.g. a generic term likely to hit at least one indexed article, such as `"help"` or `"return"`). Confirm the response contains a non-empty `knowledgeSummary` / retrieval-results array. An empty result here — even with status=SUCCESS — is the classic silent-failure signature and means the Data Space scope or the Einstein Agent User's Data Cloud assignment is broken.
  - If the library is not Activated: activate it and re-check.
  - If retrieval returns empty despite SUCCESS status: surface the **Known manual step** (Data Space scope on the permission set) to the user verbatim, wait for confirmation that they've completed it in Setup, then re-run the canary query. Do not proceed to Checkpoint 4 with an empty retrieval.

    > **Known manual step — Data Space scope for the Einstein Agent User.** When grounding is configured (Knowledge ADL), the Einstein Agent User needs Data Cloud access for the ADL retriever to return content. The `agentforce-generate` skill's setup assigns the required permission set (e.g. `GenieUserEnhancedSecurity`) and PSL (`GenieDataPlatformStarterPsl`) automatically. **However, the Data Space scope on that permission set is a UI-only assignment** — there's no API to grant it. If grounded queries return empty `knowledgeSummary` after ADL indexing completes, pause the flow and instruct the user to:
    > 1. Setup → Permission Sets → **Data Cloud User** (`GenieUserEnhancedSecurity`)
    > 2. Open the assignment for the Einstein Agent User → **Data Space Access** → add the default Data Space → Save
    >
    > Then resume validation. Do not attempt to publish the agent until a grounded test query returns non-empty `knowledgeSummary`.

**Check 3 — The messaging channel is Active AND the V2 Embedded Messaging bootstrap is actually served by the customer-facing site URL.** This catches two related failures that both ship a dead widget: (a) the Embedded Service Deployment and channel were created but the MessagingChannel was never activated, so the widget renders but no agent answers; and (b) the deployment exists but the site was never wired to load the V2 bootstrap script, so the customer-facing URL loads without a chat widget at all. Verify both, in order:

  - **(a) MessagingChannel is Active.** Fetch the MessagingChannel back from the org and assert its status is `Active` (not `Inactive`/`Draft`). `service-digital-engagement-messaging-site-integrate` does **not** own channel activation — it is deferred to `service-digital-engagement-channel-configure`, and the channel deploys INACTIVE — so do not assume activation happened as a side effect of widget placement. If the channel is not Active, activate it (it must not be activated before the agent is Active) and re-fetch to confirm the status flipped. If it still won't activate, surface the specific channel and stop — do not proceed to Checkpoint 4 with an inactive channel.
  - **(b) The V2 Embedded Messaging LWR component is placed on the site's home layout(s) with the correct `deploymentName` and endpoint attributes.** The widget is embedded via the `experience_messaging:embeddedMessaging` LWR component in `homeGuestLayout.json` (and `homeAuthenticated.json` if signed-in visitors are also expected) — **not** via a `<script>` bootstrap in `mainAppPage.json` `headMarkup`. The correct attribute is `deploymentName` (not `configurationName`, which is not a valid attribute for this component and is stripped on deploy). **The V2 component takes a full six-attribute shape that round-trips cleanly through metadata deploy/retrieve.** The end-to-end path is:

    1. **Retrieve the ExperienceBundle for the target site** to a scratch directory: `sf project retrieve start --metadata "ExperienceBundle:<SiteName>"`.
    2. **Resolve the values the component needs:**
       - `deploymentName` — the ESD's DeveloperName, e.g. `HelpChat` (from Step C.3).
       - `siteEndpoint` — the ESD's own auto-generated site URL. Query `SELECT Name, UrlPathPrefix FROM Site WHERE Name LIKE 'ESW_<DeploymentName>%'`; there will be two rows — pick the one whose `UrlPathPrefix` does **not** end in `vforcesite` (the vforcesite variant is the internal preview endpoint, not the customer-facing one). Build the endpoint as `https://<myDomainStem>.my.site.com/<UrlPathPrefix>`.
       - `scrtUrl` — the org's SCRT domain. Take the org's instance URL from `sf org display --json` and replace `.my.salesforce.com` with `.my.salesforce-scrt.com`.
       - `isExpSiteAuthMode` — `false` for public/anonymous visitors (matches the MessagingChannel `authMode: UnAuth` chosen in Step B of `channel-web-chat.md`); `true` only if the channel is `Auth`-mode.
    3. **Inject or overwrite the `experience_messaging:embeddedMessaging` component in the site's home layout(s).** For a public site the guest layout is required; for authenticated visitors add the same node to `homeAuthenticated.json`. The component node MUST include `"type": "component"` at the top level (missing it fails deploy with *"You seem to be missing the property type"*). Set `componentAttributes` to exactly these six keys:
       ```json
       {
         "componentAttributes": {
           "clientVersion": "WebV2",
           "deploymentName": "HelpChat",
           "hideChatButtonOnLoad": "Visible",
           "isExpSiteAuthMode": false,
           "scrtUrl": "https://<myDomainStem>.my.salesforce-scrt.com",
           "siteEndpoint": "https://<myDomainStem>.my.site.com/ESW<DeploymentName><timestamp>"
         },
         "componentName": "experience_messaging:embeddedMessaging",
         "id": "<uuid>",
         "renderPriority": "NEUTRAL",
         "renditionMap": {},
         "type": "component"
       }
       ```
       Any older `configurationName`-shaped node from a previous run must be replaced, not merged — the platform silently drops `configurationName` and the node round-trips with `componentAttributes: {}`.
    4. **Patch the ESD via the Tooling API to allow guest users (do not use Metadata API for this).** Metadata API rejects any update that touches the ESD's `site` field with an immutable-field error, even if you pass the current value unchanged. Use the Tooling REST API instead:
       ```http
       PATCH /services/data/v67.0/tooling/sobjects/EmbeddedServiceConfig/<id>
       {"Metadata": { ...all current Metadata fields..., "areGuestUsersAllowed": true, "clientVersion": "WebV2", "isEnabled": true }}
       ```
       **Read the current `Metadata` first with a GET and include every field on the PATCH** — omitting a field (e.g. `clientVersion`, `branding`, `masterLabel`) nulls it out on write. Successful PATCH returns HTTP 204.
    5. **Deploy the ExperienceBundle** back to the org: `sf project deploy start -m "ExperienceBundle:<SiteName>"`.
    6. **Publish the site.** Use the site's **community name** (from `Network.Name`) — not the site's `Site.Name`. On some org shapes these can differ: e.g. `Site.Name = Consumer_Site1` but `Network.Name = "Consumer Site"`. Query `SELECT Name FROM Network WHERE Status = 'Live'` to get the community name, then `sf community publish -n "<CommunityName>"`. `sf community publish` returns immediately; poll `SELECT Status FROM BackgroundOperation WHERE Id='<jobId>'` and wait for `Complete`.
    7. **Verify by retrieving the ExperienceBundle again and confirming all six `componentAttributes` keys survived the round-trip. Then verify the widget renders by opening the live customer URL in a guest browser.** Do NOT use <!-- skill-validate: ignore-start -->`curl | grep`<!-- skill-validate: ignore-end --> to check for the widget — the launcher mounts at runtime and is not present in the server-rendered HTML the raw GET returns, so a curl check will always report "missing" and lead to a wrong diagnosis. The check that matters: open `<customerSiteUrl>` in an incognito window and confirm the floating chat launcher (branded label like "Ask Me Anything") appears bottom-right. Only then does the widget count as placed.

    **Placement scope: the widget is placed on the home layouts you inject the component into.** Unlike the bootstrap-in-`mainAppPage.json` approach (which was site-wide), the LWR-component approach is per-layout. If the user wants the widget on every page of the site, either add the component to each page's layout JSON or (simpler) drop it onto the site's site-wide template in Experience Builder. This is a deliberate tradeoff: metadata-component placement is more surgical but more work to fan out to every page than a headMarkup script would be.

    **When to fall back to Experience Builder UI.** If the metadata round-trip in step 7 still shows attributes stripped after two retries — or if `sf community publish` reports errors — surface the problem to the user and direct them to place the component manually in Experience Builder (Setup → Digital Experiences → All Sites → Builder → drag *Embedded Messaging* onto the page → pick `HelpChat` from the *Deployment Name* dropdown → Publish). The UI is the authoritative fallback path; do not chase deploy failures indefinitely.

Only after all three checks pass silently, advance to Checkpoint 4. The user should experience Checkpoint 3.5 as a brief pause, not as an announced step.

### 4.5 Checkpoint 4 — Review & Go Live

Once the agent and channel(s) are deployed:
1. Tell the user the agent is built, and **link them to Agentforce Builder** for this agent so they can review the agent definition, subagents, and topics.
2. For the Web Chat / Help Portal path, embed the V2 Embedded Messaging LWR component on the site's home layout(s). Follow the retrieve→inject-component→Tooling-PATCH-ESD→deploy→publish→retrieve-round-trip→live-browser-verify path documented in Checkpoint 3.5 Check 3(b) — that is the verified end-to-end path for a V2 ESD. The correct component is `experience_messaging:embeddedMessaging` with the six-attribute V2 shape (`clientVersion`, `deploymentName`, `hideChatButtonOnLoad`, `isExpSiteAuthMode`, `scrtUrl`, `siteEndpoint`); `deploymentName` is the ESD DeveloperName. Do NOT verify placement with <!-- skill-validate: ignore-start -->`curl | grep`<!-- skill-validate: ignore-end --> — the widget mounts at runtime and is not present in server-rendered HTML, so a curl check will always report "missing" and mislead the diagnosis. The verification that matters: retrieve the ExperienceBundle back after publish and confirm all six `componentAttributes` keys survived the round-trip, then open the live customer URL in an incognito browser and confirm the floating chat launcher renders.

3. **Wire the Escalation Flow to the agent.** The Quick Setup flow creates an Escalation Flow that routes conversations to a live human, but the created flow is **not automatically wired to the Help Agent's Escalation subagent**. Do this explicitly:
   - Query the org for an existing Flow with DeveloperName `Help_Agent_Escalation_Flow` (or the canonical name your org uses). If it exists (from a previous run), **reuse it** — do not create a duplicate. If it does not exist, direct the user to Setup → Agentforce Studio → Quick Setup → run the "Escalation" step, and ask them to name the flow `Help_Agent_Escalation_Flow` so subsequent runs reuse it deterministically.
   - Once the Flow is present, wire it on the agent in **Agentforce Builder → Settings → Escalation → Escalation Flow → select `Help_Agent_Escalation_Flow`**. Then save. Escalation returns to the router if the flow is not wired; the agent won't actually hand off to a human.

4. **Activate the Messaging Channel.** Even if Checkpoint 3.5 flipped it Active for you, verify one more time before declaring go-live: Setup → Messaging Settings → **Help Chat** → confirm the "Activate" button is greyed out / status shows Active. If the button is still live and the channel is Inactive, click Activate. A published deployment with an inactive channel silently drops all inbound messages.

5. **Verify the Embedded Service Deployment is published (V2, Version stamped).** If Step C.3 of `references/channel-web-chat.md` was followed correctly, the ESD was created *and* published in a single call via the Connect API `POST /services/data/v67.0/connect/embeddedmessaging/deployment/setup` (with `clientVersion: WebV2`) — that response includes `"isPublishSuccess": true` and no further publish step is needed. Verify the outcome by opening Setup → Embedded Service Deployments → **Help Chat** and checking:
   - Title reads *"Embedded Service Deployment Settings - Web"* with **no `(v1)` suffix and no "Switch to V2" button**.
   - Top-right shows *"Published on: {date}"* and *"Version: 1"* (not empty).

   **If *Published on:* is blank even though the title reads *Web (v2)* and `IsEnabled=true`** — and especially if the Publish button shows a red *"Select a Messaging Channel and then try publishing again."* banner — the ESD was created **without a messaging channel bound** (the `deployment/setup` call omitted `messagingChannelId`). This is the most common publish failure. Clicking "Publish" in the UI will not fix it (a V2 deployment offers no channel to select there). Delete the ESD (`sf project delete source -m EmbeddedServiceConfig:HelpChat`) and recreate via the Connect API path in Step C.3 **with `messagingChannelId` (and `hostDomain`) in the body** — see the CRITICAL note under Step C.3.

   **If instead the title still says `(v1)`**, the ESD was created via bare Metadata deploy instead of the Connect API — that path is V1-only and provides no supported API to publish. **Do not tell the user to click "Publish" in the UI as a fix** — the button will publish a V1 deployment that Enhanced Web Chat cannot use. Delete the V1 ESD and recreate via the Connect API path in Step C.3. An unpublished or V1 deployment never serves the widget to visitors, even when the channel is Active.

6. Confirm: once published, the help agent is live. Offer to test it together.

Stay in the conversation; don't end abruptly. Ask if they want to make any adjustments before signing off.

## 5. Placeholders to fill in (script companion)

The canonical agent script contains several `<...>` placeholders (agent label, developer name, welcome message, tone, default agent user, `rag_feature_config_id`, locale). Most are captured in Checkpoint 1 / Checkpoint 2 above. The full list, with example values and where each comes from, lives alongside the script in [`references/agent-script.md`](../references/agent-script.md) — read it when you load the script (after Checkpoint 2).

## 6. Deployment target

Connect to whichever Salesforce org is currently authenticated. All resources (agent, ADL, channels, sites) are created in that org. Authenticate the target org before running the prompt.

---

## 7. Canonical agent script (Quick ASA Help Agent template)

The full canonical agent script — the source-of-truth shape for topics, subagents, actions, instructions, and grounding config — lives in [`references/agent-script.md`](../references/agent-script.md), together with the placeholder list (§5) and the agent-shape summary (§2).

**Load it only when you are ready to create the agent — after Checkpoint 2**, once the Checkpoint 1 placeholders and the `rag_feature_config_id` are in hand. It is comprehension-and-generation material, not part of the interactive conversation, so keeping it out of context during Checkpoints 1, 3, and 4 saves a large number of tokens. Where the script conflicts with anything in this spec, the behavioral rules in §3–§4 win.
